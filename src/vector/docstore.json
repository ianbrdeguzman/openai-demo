Quincke and Walter E. Wynter.Present-day LP is a common procedure in emergency medicine used to diagnose or exclude potentially life-threatening conditions such as subarachnoid hemorrhage and bacterial meningitis. Non-emergency LP can be useful in the diagnosis of other conditions such as multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and paraneoplastic syndromes, among others.

Indications and Special ConsiderationsMeningitisLP for CSF analysis remains the only diagnostic procedure that can be used to definitively exclude the diagnosis of meningitis. PITFALLSIn patients with a high pretest probability for bacterial meningitis, antimicrobial therapy (with consideration for adjunctive dexamethasone) should be initiated without delay. This should not be construed as a recommendation to delay LP in patients with suspected bacterial meningitis. Although conclusive data are limited, some studies have shown that the yield of CSF cultures can decrease as early as 2 to 4 h after the initiation of antimicrobial therapy.Caution should be used when considering LP in a patient with suspected bacterial meningitis and rapidly deteriorating neurological status, as this could suggest an increased risk of cerebral herniation after LP.

However, its sensitivity is decreased in patients who receive antibiotics prior to CSF analysis, and normal CSF lactate values may vary between labs and institutions.Common CSF characteristics in CNS infectionsThe Bacterial Meningitis Score can identify children with meningitis who are at very low risk for bacterial meningitis.Pediatric patients with meningitis who have none of the following high-risk features are considered to have a very low risk for bacterial meningitis.Positive CSF Gram stainCSF protein >80 mg/dLCSF absolute neutrophil count >1,000 cells/mm3 Peripheral blood","metadata":{"source":"https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recdsxPS10gt6lsne/Lumbar-Puncture","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["6",{"pageContent":"blood absolute neutrophil count >10,000 cells/mm3 Seizure before or at presentationA retrospective review of 441 patients suggested that the Bacterial Meningitis Score may also be useful in adult patients and could reduce hospitalizations.Subarachnoid HemorrhageTraditionally, a negative computed tomography (CT) scan has NOT been considered sufficiently sensitive to rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage, and therefore has generally been followed by LP (and/or, more recently, CT angiography [CTA]) for further evaluation.The Ottawa Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Rule has been shown to be 100% sensitive for ruling out non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage in alert and neurologically intact patients, potentially identifying a group of patients in whom neither CT nor LP is necessary.As CT technology has improved, the need for further testing—whether CTA, LP, or both—following a negative CT scan has come into question, especially when the CT is performed within the first 6 h following symptom onset.Recent literature suggests that a non-contrast head CT (third-generation or newer) performed within 6 h of onset of severe headache concerning for subarachnoid","metadata":{"source":"https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recdsxPS10gt6lsne/Lumbar-Puncture","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["7",{"pageContent":"hemorrhage (and interpreted by a neuroradiologist or general radiologist who routinely reviews head CTs) may be sufficiently accurate to exclude subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients with a low pretest probability.As with most situations, it is important to remember that clinical context and pre-test probability matter. This is illustrated in a case report by Chakraborty et al., in which they describe a patient with a negative head CT within 6 h of onset of thunderclap headache, altered mental status, and meningismus in the context of anemia.Given the presentation, and despite the negative CT, an LP was performed that suggested subarachnoid hemorrhage, and follow-up CT showed small intraventricular hemorrhage. Subsequent CTA found an intradural carotid artery aneurysm, which was repaired. PEARLSThe most recent American College of Emergency Physicians Clinical Guidelines recommend LP or CTA to rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage in adult patients still considered at risk for subarachnoid hemorrhage after a negative non-contrast head CT.

Distinguishing true subarachnoid hemorrhage from traumatic LP (“traumatic tap”) can be challenging, and specific cutoff values for ruling out subarachnoid hemorrhage are lacking. Xanthochromia, a yellow discoloration of the supernatant of centrifuged CSF due to hemoglobin breakdown, is thought to require several hours to develop after the onset of bleeding. However, the minimum time and minimum amount of blood required for the detection of xanthochromia are not known. Some authors have suggested that spectrophotometric determination of xanthochromia is superior to visual methods, but most hospitals still use visual methods. While xanthochromia alone can have variable sensitivity, 1 study reported that the composite evaluation of xanthochromia and CSF RBC count is 100% sensitive.A prospective study evaluating 1,739 patients with acute non-traumatic headache who underwent LP to rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage concluded that the absence of xanthochromia and the presence of fewer than 2,000 × 106 RBCs/L (2,000 RBCs/mm3) in the final collection","metadata":{"source":"https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recdsxPS10gt6lsne/Lumbar-Puncture","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["9",{"pageContent":"collection tube “reasonably exclude” the diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Regardless, consideration must be given for the presence of traumatic LP and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Some have estimated that the pressure decreases approximately 1.5 cm H2O for every 1 mL of CSF removed.LP to relieve symptoms of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is controversial and temporary at best, with some studies suggesting that the pressure can return to previous levels within less than 2 h after the procedure.

Additionally, there are no clear thresholds for administration or guidelines for use.TechniquePatient PositioningThe lateral recumbent position is preferred, as this will allow for an opening pressure measurement. The patient assumes a fetal position close to one side of the bed, bringing knees toward the chest and arching the lower back as much as possible. Shoulders and hips should remain perpendicular to the bed. A pillow is used to keep the head in line with the spine, and another pillow may be placed between the knees for comfort.

The feet are supported to keep the knees closer to the chest and to allow maximum opening of the lower lumbar interspaces.Prone positioning is typically reserved for LP performed with fluoroscopic guidance and is most commonly performed by a radiologist.Site IdentificationThe back and hips are palpated to identify the lower lumbar interspaces. This may be done prior to patient positioning if the area is going to be marked in advance. Radiographically, the intercristal line connects the highest point of each posterior–superior iliac crest. This line intersects with the midline at the L4 spinous process or L4-L5 interspace in most patients. Clinically, however, palpation of this line usually corresponds to the L3 spinous process or L3-L4 interspace. Ultrasound can also be used to identify the target interspace.

Some studies suggest that this can increase the risk of post-dural puncture headache, while others do not support this. Finer needles are less rigid, making it technically more difficult to penetrate the soft tissues. The flow of CSF can be noticeably slower with needles smaller than 22-ga.Traditional/cutting needles (usually Quincke type) are found in most standard kits; these have sharp cutting bevels with stylets in the lumen.Newer, atraumatic needles, including the Sprotte, Whitacre, and Gertie Marx needles, are also styletted but have side ports to withdraw CSF. The incidence of post-dural puncture headache is lower with these needles, thereby limiting the need for an epidural blood patch.

Other options include attempting the procedure at a higher or lower interspace or having the patient move to the seated position.Use of the additional needle and supplemental lidocaine may be necessary at this time.Alternative ApproachesThe paramedian approach avoids the supraspinous and interspinous ligaments, which may be calcified in elderly or arthritic patients. This approach can be easier and less painful in some patients, with fewer attempts needed.The set-up is similar to that of the midline approach, except that a longer needle may be necessary, as it enters the subarachnoid space at an angle.

The patient is then instructed to relax and extend his/her legs to allow an unimpeded flow of CSF and prevent false elevation of the opening pressure, although some studies have shown that the effect of this maneuver is minimal. Patients who are struggling (eg, infants) will also have inaccurate readings.Normal opening pressure is 5-20 cm H2O. An elevation can indicate increased intracranial pressure, which can commonly be caused by infection or idiopathic intracranial hypertension.Sample CollectionThe 4 specimen tubes are filled sequentially, starting with the fluid from the manometer.Each tube should receive at least 1 mL of CSF.It is common to remove a total of about 8 mL of CSF during the procedure.

ComplicationsCerebral HerniationCerebral herniation is perhaps the most devastating complication of LP and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is thought to occur due to pressure gradients that may be exacerbated by the removal of even small amounts of CSF by LP. The true incidence of this complication is low, possibly less than 2%, even in patients with evidence of intracranial mass effect.In addition to intracranial lesions with mass effect, Chiari malformation is a risk factor for cerebral herniation. The conditions for which an emergency LP is indicated themselves carry an increased risk of herniation. For example, some estimates of the risk of herniation in bacterial meningitis range from 3% to over 13%.Furthermore, the majority of patients with bacterial meningitis who suffer cerebral herniation do not have identifiable abnormalities on CT.

Intraspinal Epidermoid TumorIntraspinal epidermoid tumors are rare and can occur congenitally or can be acquired. Acquired epidermoid tumors account for up to 40% of these lesions. They are a late complication of LP, trauma, or other procedures and require anywhere from 2 to 23 y to develop.The risk of these tumors as a result of LP is thought to be greatest in the pediatric population. The incidence of this complication has dropped dramatically with the introduction and use of smaller-bore and styletted needles.Additional InformationGuidelinesIDSA: Bacterial MeningitisACEP: Issues in the Evaluation and Management of Patients in the ED with Acute Headache ESCMID: diagnosis and treatment of acute bacterial meningitisLumbar puncture in patients with neurological diseasesReferencesAbbrescia KL, Brabson TA, Dalsey WC, et al.
